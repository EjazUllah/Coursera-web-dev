        <p><b>Zhob district education sector plan flows from the provincial Balochistan Education Sector Plan (BESP). Many of the strategies in the document derive from the BESP but have been adjusted according to the needs of the district and its position, and limitations, in the governance structure. The aspects of access, equity, quality and governance and management have all been covered.It appears that district options get most limited in case of quality as most quality related supply institutions are at the provincial level. However, the sector plan emphasizes the need
            for the district to get more involved, and proactive, approach. Also they need to take more responsibility for quality of the teaching and learning process.
            Zhob district faces a number of education related challenges in terms of access and quality both. Article 25-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been made the basis of the targets faced by the district. BESP also used the same framework for the provincial indicators. The Article stipulates free and compulsory education for children between ages 5 to 16 as a fundamental right. The Constitution allows each province to prepare its own law for implementation. Government of Balochistan has already passed ‘The Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2014’. This Act makes the government responsible for bearing all the education-related costs inclusive of stationery, schoolbags, school meals and transport for the children falling in the aforementioned age group. This bill further stipulates that free and compulsory education is imparted to every child regardless of sex, nationality or race in a neighborhood school.</b></p><b>
